Scripts for verifying wind ramp events

More information about wind ramps: Bianco et al. (2016, WAF, https://doi.org/10.1175/WAF-D-15-0144.1)

Sample thresholds for cut-in speed, rated speed, and cut-out speed:

TO DO
-----
- Add scripts so that the wind ramp verification can easily be run for several output times

General Process
---------------
For both the NR and RRFS...
    - Extract U and V and 80 m using wgrib2
    - Compute 80-m wind speed using wgrib2
    - Use MET PCP-Combine to compute 80-m wind speed diffs between two times
    - [NR only] Create a mask that only includes points in CONUS with 80-m winds > the cut-in speed and < rated speed

Use MET GridStat to verify 80-m wind differences using the mask the isolates CONUS grid points 
with winds between the cut-in speed an rated speed

Directions
----------
- Run process_NR_output_for_wind_ramp.sh and process_RRFS_output_for_wind_ramp.sh
- Manually move output from the above scripts to an ./output/ directory
- Run run_GridStat.sh

Testing
-------
The check_ctc.py script checks whether the verification is being performed properly.

Contingency table counts differ when being computed in Python vs MET. This is b/c the wind speeds
differ slightly (i.e., round-off error) when computed in Python vs wgrib2. When accounting for this
difference, the contingency table counts match.

Also took a quick peek at the mask generated here. The plotted mask looks reasonable and wind speeds
less than 3 m/s and greater than 15 m/s are indeed masked.
